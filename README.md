## 1. [CodeF dataset](https://github.com/CodeGeneration3/KareCoder/tree/main/CodeF%20dataset)
Firstly, We make the CodeF dataset publicly available. You can find our dataset, and in the reademe document we have detailed information about the data set and difficulty subsets. In addition, we provide a table of the difficulty distribution of the problems in both parts of the dataset, CodeF Pre2021-9 and CodeF Post2021-9. Finally, you can get the raw data of the CodeF dataset unprocessed by code de-duplication here.
## 2. [Knowledge Libraries](https://github.com/CodeGeneration3/KareCoder/tree/main/Knowledge%20Libraries)
We make the Knowledge Libraries (Knowledge Description, Knowledge Pseudo-Code and Knowledge Step of Pseudo-Code) that we use in Knowledge-Aware Code Generation with Large Language Models publicly available. 
## 3. [Illustration of Prompt Engineering and Coding Stages](https://github.com/CodeGeneration3/KareCoder/tree/main/Illustration%20of%20Prompt%20Engineering%20and%20Coding%20Stages)
We provide a detailed illustration of input and output for both the Prompt Engineering and Coding Stages.
